      <h3>Re Memory</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      A sunbeam so golden-orange it seems molten honey is pouring through the slit between the hot pink curtain and the angel pink wall catches the drifting, glittering specs of dust and long thin strands of dog hair in amber. At that moment long ago they were not completely still, but in the vivid snapshot of memory, they are suspended in space.

      <p>
      She is physically at her cramped desk in a spacious room, staring at, into, beyond a screen with black and white words. She can see her fingers tapping out these characters, feels the raised bump on f and j and the heat of the keyboard as her computer runs dozens of applications at once. But she’s also in that pink pink pink room, it’s 7:30 in the morning, and the sun in all its glory is cresting the mountain outside to seep the room in honey and glitter and fuchsia. She’s opened her eyes to admire the whirls of dust and fur, and now she sits up and attempts to dip her fingers into the golden ambrosia slice.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Did she actually do this? Or was this time travel: an interaction with the past, with memory, a vision of a different timeline. These fingers were not those of a six-year-old; there were the purple scars on the back of her hand that she’d gotten as a 19-year-old. And the room was not all there, not all recollected in every minute detail, just the bed with its patchwork green-pink quilt, and the general shape, and the mirrored sliding doors of the closet (which if she peered into she could not see her face, but the rest of her body was there).
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She swirls her fingers slowly, teasing the dust to life. The past and the present blur and then melt together, old and new fur together, some long gone or recently gone at present, some not yet existing in past. Dogs had always been in her life but now seeing the short black wavy strands lazily sailing on glowing drafts of snowy morning air, mingling with the long, fine, white hairs and coarser yellow hairs as the invisible dance of static electricity waltzed through the currents, she couldn’t help but wish that the dogs were never there at all.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      In this false reality, unreal memory, fevered daydream, she could hear him still, feel his little paw with the nails just a bit too sharp digging into her forearm as he begged her to pet him. The way his ears cocked and his head tilted when you said t-r-e-a-t or d-i-n-n-e-r or w-a-l-k or c-l-a-r-k because he was smart and could read your intentions and she always had to spell those words out otherwise he’d go bonkers jumping up and down and causing all that gorgeous dust and fur trapped in that portion of sun to run scrambling into the heavens.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      But now, even just a day later, and his eyes and features and fur are blurring just like the rest of her room, and as she reaches into the abyss of memory all she feels are the heat of the keyboard, the bumps on f and j, the artificial hard warmth of a machine that can’t even begin to compare with the softness of fur windswept and salty from his last walk. And she tries to forget him, to block him out because now the heat of her keyboard is reaching her eyes and her heart and the flowing lava that pops and sparks as it flows through her body is hardening into a thick rock and she can’t move, can’t speak, can’t float.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Yet, in the depths of the obsidian pool formed from this magma, the same color as him, she knows that the memories she has and can interact with—the idea of his bark, his frantic smile, his pattering paws—will eventually be like the golden-orange sunbeam; a ray of light.
