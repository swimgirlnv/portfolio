        <h3>Landscape Assignment</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        The top of the mountain gave birth to the wind. From nothing, something, the movement of what little air was available at this altitude. And the wind swirled and laughed with its newfound existence, tumbling amongst the fallen snow in the dawn light. Leaping into the atmosphere it sighed with contentment admiring the vast bowl before it that it yearned to explore. Jagged mountains like weathered fingers reach up to pluck the remaining stars out of the dusty pink sky. The palm of the great hand gingerly holds a crystal blue lake, cradling it like a delicate pocket mirror.

        Gracefully floating back to earth, the wind takes one last look at this peak's lonely crag, then turns to the slope of the mountain. With a sharp crack, a chunk of snow breaks from the cliff and tumbles into a small avalanche; the wind races after it with devious glee. Deep into the Mt. Rose wilderness the wind and snow cavort together until the snow slows and rolls to a stop. The wind slows too, but only for a moment before it continues its exploration of the mountain. Here. A cave that’s partially blocked by some pine boughs and needles. The wind paces in front of the cave, unsure of how to enter the space.

        From within, a deep snuffling, a bit of shuffling, and a half snore. The wind circles back, and on the back of slivers of weak sunlight, it pierced the warm and dark lair. Inside, a dark shadow breathing heavily in sleep. The wind tentatively snakes through the darkness before escaping back into the open mountain air. Scattering into different directions, the wind gathers the scents of newly opening pine needles, cold snow, hatching fish, ripening berries, and fresh honey. With all these infused, it squeezes back into the cave to tickle the sleeping creature’s nose.

        With a grumbling groan, the bear opens his eyes and blinks once, twice, in the dim light of the rock cave. Something plop plops on his head, his nose, his hindquarters, and his back; snowmelt seeping into the cave and running in damp rivulets down the walls. He sighs and shakes his head, then swipes at the makeshift bough barrier, sweeping aside the branches and allowing warm sunlight to dance joyously into the space.

        He lumbers to his paws, stretching each limb until it shakes, before finally sticking his nose out into the spring morning. Snow still covers this glade in a crisp blanket, the top layer more ice after melting the day before and freezing overnight. Tentatively, he places a paw into the clearing, testing his weight. Almost immediately, he crunches through to the soft snow underneath, and he shivers as cold wetness touches the sensitive skin between the pads on his paws. He stills.

        Wind, gentle and breathing the sweetened smell of new life forcing itself up through the snow, caresses the bear's face with a kind hand. He watches as the breeze splits, like the sunlight refracting off the glittering snow. One wisp stays behind his ears, scratching the spot he can’t quite reach. Others chase each other around the glade, stirring up shimmering powder in little whirlwinds before scampering up and around the trees like little squirrels. They shake the pine branches up above, making the trees sigh with pleasure.

        The wind calls to its brethren circling the top of the peaks and to the breezes whirling across the distant lake, starting with a low moan and then as it lifts up into the air raising its voice to a melodic note. The puff of air behind the bear’s ears crawls down to his paws, tugging him along into the snow, and then up farther on the mountain path. All around him, curious gusts peek through copses of aspens and pines, rustling the leaves and needles in greeting. Spring has painted them brilliant greens, and the rippling wind and now glaring sun send frolicking shadows racing across the snow banks.

        The bear makes his way slowly up the mountain pausing to appreciate the gifts the wind brings him. Here, the scent of thawing dirt and new bulbs beginning to sprout into the smallest of flower buds. There, the distant sound of a waterfall bursting to life through its icy prison. One breeze twirls his fur and rolls along his back, only to be pushed aside by another who plants chilled kisses along his snout.
