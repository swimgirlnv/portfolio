        <p>“Tell me the story! Tell it, tell it! The one about how I was—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“What Beeble? Hold on let me make room for you, shoo Lumpy! Ok, you climb in right here.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“Ew but there’s dog fur everywhere! It stinks!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“Come on, you can come under the covers.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“Ok, but can you tell me the story?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“What’s the magic word?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“Puh-leeeease?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>“So the story of where you came from, let’s see—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Where do babies come from?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Well you were a very special baby so I’ll tell you where you came from. See, Dada and I were on our honeymoon by the ocean when suddenly—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “OWWWW Lumpy! That hurts!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Let him lay down, sweet pea, he just wants a hug!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “But he punched me!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Will the tickle monster make it better?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “No no no, no thank you. Ok, Lumpy, come here and you can listen too.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Alright, so we were on our honeymoon. And we were walking on the beach when suddenly this great big wave crashed onto the sand and we heard a giggle!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Wait, what’s a honeymoon?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “It’s a little trip we took after our wedding—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Did you… kiss? Was it terribly romantic like a princess movie?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “It was very romantic! But it didn’t last very long because we heard the giggling from the waves on the beach!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “What did you do?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Well your dad and I rushed to see where the sound was coming from and as we got closer to the surf we saw a little baby mermaid! And off in the waves was a family of mermaids that asked us if we could take care of her for a little while, so we tried to pick her up!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Did you take any pictures of the mermaids?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “No, we didn’t have the fancy phones that we have now, and our camera was back in our room. But we tried to pick her up and she was so slippery she almost wriggled back into the waves!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Was she like this?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Oh Beeble too much, too much! You’re going to scare Lumpy!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Ok, I’m sorry Lumpy! Come here I want to give you a big squeeze.” 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “She did squirm around a lot, but we did what the mermaids asked and we bundled her up in a bunch of blankets and hugged her like this—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Moowm!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “And gave her a big squeeze like this—”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “MOOWM!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “And we saw she had little gills and little webs on her fingers but once she came out the ocean she grew two little legs with big feet like flippers!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “That’s why I’m so good at swimming now!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Exactly!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “But why don’t I ever have a pretty mermaid tail when I swim in the pool?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “The mermaids told me that you would only get your tail back when you swim in the ocean in San Francisco, so your tail magic is probably blocked by all the chlorine in the pool.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “But it’s so cold there! I don’t believe you!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “They said you probably wouldn’t believe me, so they told me to tell you that you can see your mermaid mama’s kiss on your forehead whenever you get angry or frustrated. Go look now!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Really? Beep beep, Lumpy!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Come here baby, she’s so silly.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Mom look! I’ve got a red mark on my forehead! Is that my mermaid mama’s kiss?” 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Yes! Now come here so I can give you a kiss before you go to bed.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Aww I don’t want to go to bed yet. Can we watch the dancing star show?”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Hmm, only if you go get your dad so we can all watch it together.”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Okay! DAD!”
