        <h3>The Dual Meet</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        The pool stretches out before Kára, only 25 yards but this morning it looks so much longer. Just beyond the City of Coronado Aquatics Center’s glass walls, she can hear the pulsing of waves slapping the harbor wall. When the sun comes up in a few hours, she’ll be able to see the shores of San Diego Bay, but in this near-total darkness, nothing really exists outside the pool. She squints at the blue water sparkling under the gleam of the fluorescent stadium lights, the wind pushing little ripples across the surface as the early morning Southern California breeze tosses and turns across the deck. The sun still has some time before it would rise over the ocean, and Kára hugs her arms to her chest to keep out the chill, not that it helps much. Her navy blue swimsuit is no match for the gusts of cool air, and she tries not to shiver. When she’d moved here for the year from Nor-Cal, she’d expected warm weather 24/7, but the coastal air conditioning decided otherwise. Not that it was any better up north—in fact, this morning would be on the warmer side given the seasons changing from winter to spring, but Kára still felt the chill digging down to her bones.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Her teammates excitedly sputter through chattering teeth to each other, complaining about the early morning, the breeze, the thought of the swim meet ahead. Penguin huddles form as swimmers gather together to fight off the growing wind. Some boys trying to be funny even attempt to stretch their silicone swim caps over their arms, distorting the team name ‘Einherjar’ as the rubber stretched awkwardly.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Looks like clouds are coming back,” Kára mutters under her breath, eyeing the intimidating bank of nimbus puff-balls scooting in from the bay. Their wisps and curls are eerily outlined by the stadium lights, like claws reaching out from the tumultuous sky. There are neither stars nor moon, though, just a black void above the clouds. Kára shakes the image of a giant spectral wolf descending from the heavens from her head, giggling a little. She spells out Z-O-I-N-K-S in her head, emphasizing the color, shape, and movement of each letter to keep her thoughts from racing back to visions of demons.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        The grumbling on deck lowers in volume as the coaches step through the rainbow-colored gates, Coach Otto proudly strutting in the lead followed closely behind by a scurrying Coach Troy. Everyone’s eyes follow Otto, his movements angular and sharp as he swings a black stopwatch on a dark cord like a weapon. A few dark grey seagulls swoop around him, but he seems unfazed. Like prey timidly observing a threat, the team moves like a shoal toward safety near Troy. Despite the morning cool, he is clutching a Trenta iced shaken espresso, 2% milk today instead of whole (to work on his figure), extra shot of espresso. His round hands shake, perhaps from nerves or from caffeine, as he begins to hand out sheets of paper with the events, heats, and lanes printed. The appearance of the papers sends a wave of movement as people start putting on swim caps and goggles, preparing for battle. Kára, along with the rest of the girls, begins to twist her damp hair into a high ponytail. Kára’s fingers, still stiff with sleep, desperately attempt to confine her thick, dark curls into her bright pink hair-tie.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Oh damn it,” she curses as the elastic breaks, stinging her fingers.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Need another hair-tie?” Embla mumbles as she puts her water bottle down next to Kára’s. Without waiting for a response, she pulls a neon green one from her wrist and waves it toward Kára. “I won’t need it, you know, cause . . .” she breaks off as she points towards her head. She’s cut her hair again and bleached it, so she now looks almost like Lisa Simpson. Her red swimsuit adds to the idea growing in Kára’s head, and she ducks her head to hide a growing grin.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “You look good!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “I know,” Embla responds, tossing nonexistent locks of hair over her shoulder before toying with her earrings: a miniature fried egg in her right ear and a miniature tomato in her left. “You, however, look like a train wreck. Did you get caught in some sprinklers on the way to the pool?” she questions as she twists the tomato so its green top points towards her temple. Kára snorts, rubbing her eyes with her free hand.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Oh yeah, I just decided to warm up in a puddle outside my house,” she replies. In reality, an incessant drizzle had trailed Kára the whole walk across the island as she made her way to the pool. Not enough to soak her to the flesh but enough to make her as grumpy as a soggy cat. 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Alright, Einherjar, let’s get ready to go, the pool will open soon,” Otto barks, pushing dark sunglasses up his nose. No matter the time of day, no one had ever seen Otto without them—rumor was he’d suffered some horrible accident to his left eye and was too embarrassed to wear an eye patch. Kára wasn’t sure: “embarrassment” and “Otto” were not words she usually put together.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Embla holds the paper while both girls scan the mix of numbers and words jumbled on the page. “What,” Kára breathes, shaking her hands back and forth palms up. No matter how hard she focuses on the symbols, none of them seem to stick in her head. Were these even English? Better yet, were these even the Latin alphabet?
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Embla, what does this say?” Kára points to the top line which read:
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        ᚠᛖᛒᚱᚢᚨᚱᛃ ᚲᛚᚨᛋᛋᛁᚲ - ᚹᚨᛚᚲᛃᚱᛁᛖᛋ ᚹᛖᚱᛋᚢᛋ ᚷᛁᚨᚾᛏᛋ
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Um, it’s the title of the meet? ‘February Classic’?” Embla side-eyes Kára.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Ah right, sorry, my eyes aren’t working today . . .” she trails off. Everything blurs for a second, like rain on a windshield. A brief moment of panic as her eyes flit around trying to shake off this unfocused haze, was Troy holding a hammer in his hand? No, the image reverts as her eyes clear. It’s just his giant coffee.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Holy rats this meet is going to be the end of the world,” Embla groans. Kára looks back at the now English sheet and stifles a complaint; she sees the events she’ll swim later this morning. . . This was definitely on the more difficult side. Plus, the times of the girls from the other team, no she couldn’t think about it! As Otto drones on about how years of training has led to this point, Troy comes to stand near Kára’s lane.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Ladies, how are we this morning?” He asks, taking a long slurp of his beverage. Funny, Kára could have sworn she’d seen him gulp at least a few times, yet the level of the coffee barely changed.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Feeling rather unprepared, I’ll be honest,” Embla shakes the paper at Troy. “Do you see what Otto put me and Kára in? This is nuts!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Otto wanted everyone to do something different, hey, I don’t make the rules around here!” Troy throws his hands in the air like he’s innocent. His eyes show a sense of worry, though, as if he too is nervous about the swim meet ahead. Or maybe he’s concerned about the quickly receding waves in the bay just outside the pool, the sound of water sucking over rock reaching Kára’s ears even through the walls. 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “I like your mitten,” Kára mumbles, pointing to the singular glove Troy wore. She hadn’t noticed it when he walked in, she supposed he’d put it on sometime between her eyes unfocusing and now. Troy looks down, as if he too didn’t realize it was on, and absentmindedly re-adjusts the leather strap attached to a row of iron buttons.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Oh yeah, you know, I didn’t want my hand to get cold drinking this iced coffee and all,” he blusters, stroking his formidable beard with his free hand. “Ok, enough chit-chat, let’s get ready to swim!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Meet warmups. Also known as the battlefield, a place to show your dominance. Across the pool deck, Kára can see the opposing team all decked out in black parkas. Their faces are all in permanent sneers, shoulders slumped in the couldn’t-care-less stance.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Ohhh, they just look like they’re fast,” Kára sighs as thoughts for her race claw at her consciousness.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “That girl must be at least six-two, holy rats,” Embla whines, gesturing to the crowd of giants.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Which one? They’re all so tall,” Kára gulps, her muscles tightening with fear. This dual meet—Otto’s Einherjar versus these giants—would be an impossible battle for points.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        As Kára wrapped her toes over the edge of the pool the sun had finally made an appearance, or at least the sky turned completely aglow. The clouds, puffy and grey, were cracked in uneven globs that spilled out a deep pulsating orange, like burning embers. Yet there was no fiery orb hanging in the sky, just this violent radiance that turned everything into a hellscape. In the distance, over the roiling ocean, Kára could see lightning forming spiderwebs that arced down to the water. The sound of thunder and the booming of the waves in the bay sounded like a march for war. The pool, blue only minutes ago, looks like lava as it reflected the sky.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “What the-” Kára starts, pulling off her goggles to look around at the blazing sunrise. The opposing team doesn’t seem phased, shucking their parkas and lining up in a giant mob on the other side of Kára’s lane. No, they might steal the rest of the meet, but Kára couldn’t let them take her lane. A whistle blows, the pool is open for warm-up.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Charging into battle, Kára jumps into the pool along with Embla and the rest of her teammates. Would it be enough to turn them away? The water is cold, smooth and slightly salty. There’s a surge of power as she slices through the glowing water, her arms like spears stabbing into the surface with each stroke. Everything is perfect and fast, Kára’s fears melt away as she lets the water embrace her. Almost to the wall, beginning her flip turn when, like a cannonball, the six-two giant from the other team splashes in. The lane is under attack! Hanging on the wall for dear life, Kára can’t help but gape like a beached fish as the other team thunders into the lane. Embla crowds behind, watching the lane space rapidly shrink.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “It’s like a conveyor belt at the airport, all the baggage goes around and around, and it never stops. Probably because it can’t stop,” Embla manages to gurgle before she is sucked into the whirlpool.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Kára’s eyes find Troy, his figure haloed by the glowing sky. Perhaps it was the light playing tricks, but Troy appeared to be in a deep silver tunic trimmed with heavy furs, a red cape billowing around his shoulders. His beard, which had been formidably bushy just a second before, was now combed, braided, and twisted with glittering beads. His coffee was definitely gone, replaced by a giant hammer with a comically short handle that Troy swung around as he delved into battle.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “You’ve got your own assigned lane! Get out!” he was shouting, bouncing between the assigned lane for the opposing team and Kára’s pointing his hammer menacingly. The whirlpool subsides as the giants begin to spread out more evenly over the two lanes, allowing Kára to finally actually swim. She sends a prayer of thanks to Troy while she finishes warming up, keeping her mind preoccupied with the present so it wouldn’t be scared of the future. But pretty words can only keep the future at bay for so long, and before Kára is fully aware of what is happening the pool clears and a whistle blows inviting the first heat of the first event to the starting blocks.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Oh, that’s me,” Kára realizes, pushing herself quickly onto the deck and sliding past giants in lanes 1, 2, and 3 to get to her spot at lane 4. In lanes 5, 6, 7, and 8 are more giants; Kára fights the urge to shrink into herself as the competition glares at her. She has the fastest seed time in this heat for this event—the 200 freestyle—she should be the intimidating one! Yet doubt seeps into her heart as fog seeps into clothing. Fear’s icy fingers trace numbing circles through the fibers in her muscles, stiffening them as she clambers onto the blocks.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Take your marks,” the referee garbles through the microphone as Kára crouches into her starting position. Quarter seconds stretch into eternities as Kára urges her legs to stay still, her body to stay taught like a bowstring as she waits for the buzzer and
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Wah!”
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Like an arrow, she’s off into the water. Only eight laps, now six, now four, last two! A fight to the death perhaps with death itself: black spots launch across Kára’s vision, fire swallowing her lungs while pricking cold crawls up her fingers and feet. The water is pushing against her, forcing her back, pulling at her weakening arms, and dragging at her kick. Panic shoots like lightning through Kára as she sees from the corner of her goggles the arms of the giants on either side of the lane, at first in line with her and then passing her. Now she can only see their torsos, now their legs, their feet as Kára is finally swallowed by the wall. She lost. She doesn’t even have to look at the scoreboard to know it, the thundering cheers of the giants as they stomp and roar with triumph drown out any sound from the Einherjar.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        Tears swim into Kára’s eyes and she averts her gaze between the forest of legs standing behind the blocks out to the bay where the murky grey water is heaving up and down in time with her frantic gasps for air. Anything to avoid Otto’s eye.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          “Kára, great job,” Embla extends a hand toward her from behind the block to help her out of the pool. Kára shakes her head, lip trembling, but accepts the offer for help and crashes into Embla’s embrace. “Hey, that’s a tough race, you gave it your all and that’s all you can do,” she whispers soothingly into Kára’s ear before guiding her toward an open chair near the glass wall. The meet moves fiercely forward as heat after heat of giants race the 200, all pummeling the Einherjar mercilessly. Only the final heat, which Embla is in, matters for scoring points, but Kára can’t help but feel a sense of dread settling on the Einherjar. Embla sits next to Kára, her face contorted in a pout as her teeth tear into the soft skin of her inner cheek. The tangible fear in the air must be getting to her too. Kára glances down, her breathing finally slower, concern overcoming the feeling of disappointment that had been eating her.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “You’re going to kill it, Embla,” Kára hoarsely says, offering a closed hand to Embla for a fist bump. She looks up, mouth reverting to its normal upturned grin, and sinks a peace sign under Kára’s fist.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Snail!” she laughs before getting up and shaking out her body, then walks up to lane four. Kára forces her legs to carry her toward the side of the pool near Troy and Otto by the rest of the Einherjar. The whistle blows, and now it’s Embla’s heat of the 200 freestyle. Like Kára she’s surrounded by giants, her swimsuit like a little flickering flame of hope amidst the dark suits of the competition.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Let’s go Embla!” Kára screams, her cheer echoed by her battered teammates as the buzzer sounds. Like a single being, they surge toward the edge of the pool to support Embla, a wave of warriors screaming and jumping and swinging their arms in unison as she begins to pull ahead of the giants. Both sides of the pool are seething and screeching as Embla reaches the final lap, giants hot on her heels.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “Go! Go! GO!” they all roar, the success of the meet riding on Embla’s quickly rotating shoulders. Lane four and five, neck and neck, it’s unclear of who will hit the wall first, and then
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
        “YEAH!” Otto howls punching the air with his stopwatch. The Einherjar may have lost each previous heat, but Embla had saved them all.
