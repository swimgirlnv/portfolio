      <h3>You have become a worm.</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      1. What do you think of the sky?
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      So so so far away like inconceivably large. I rarely even see it, but like, compared to the grains of dirt whose size I can conceptualize when I see the sky it's like super super freaky so I just go back underground. It's blue which is a color I don’t see often too. Just weird vibes in general IMO, 3/10.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        2. Where do you want to go?
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Hmm good question - the ground around here is getting pretty stale, was thinking about moving out with my wife a couple inches south. You know, get away for a while and clear the mind. I could also be convinced to move west closer to my wife’s family but the dirt there has too many predators, not worth the risk IMO.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      3. You’ve retained your human consciousness. What do you do?
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      If I retained my human consciousness I would probably do absolutely nothing different than had I not retained it. Not only would I be alienated by the other worms for acting like a human, but I would definitely have no way of communicating with the humans and they’d probably use me as bait. I mean, I could try a smartly coordinated dance ritual to communicate, but if that's the case then there have been lots of human worms killed already.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      4. How will you dismantle the human government?
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      To dismantle the human government as a worm, I’d probably have to work in a team. Unlikely that I’d get it done myself, so perhaps offering up some of my cousins as a sacrifice to the bird faction, who could bargain with a larger animal faction until we get to the elephants or something who could just storm the cities and turn it into a savannah once more.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      5. Have you ever experienced love?
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Well like I mentioned earlier I love my worm wife (my second one, my first wife was pretty mean). I guess I love dirt too, has a bunch of food, is very cozy, and has lots of places to hide from mean animals. I guess I also love underground music festivals- when they have concerts in my backyard the vibrations go crazy and the worms all have a worm rave together which is a fun time. Except for Jerry, when he shows up it gets weird.
