      <h3>Butterfly</h3>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She supposed it all started in Pennsylvania. Do many things begin in Pennsylvania? she wondered. She wouldn’t know, she wasn’t from here. But she did know this all started in Pennsylvania, or rather, the bus ride toward the Keystone State.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Something had crawled up her nose that morning. She didn’t think it was a bug since it wasn’t wriggling around like that ant that’d waved its little antennae and tapped its little feet across her desk at home (where was home?) or shivering and shaking like that fly that bumped into her window here (was this home?). Maybe it was a little deity that’d taken residence in the cozy cave, almost like Thor and Loki in the Jotun’s mitten, but her nose was not an article of clothing. Although it was comforting to think a deity might be looking out for her, or have deemed her nose worthy to sleep in. Or maybe it was just bacteria building up, causing green snot to bubble and multiply with ferocious pressure. She didn’t like the latter of those ideas very much, so she took a few of those little red sudafed pills from CVS, packed her bags, and walked through the rain rivers on Thayer street toward the bus.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She’d left her umbrella behind, so her hair clung in uncomfortable strands to her forehead; damp and cold and smelling overwhelmingly like chlorine. No matter how much she washed her hair the smell stained it, clung to it, eau de swimmer. She tried to brush it away but the slimy ends worked with the autumn breeze to slap back onto her face. The wetness around the neck of her sweatshirt grew increasingly uncomfortable as icy, clammy hands traced droplets of rain and perspiration down her neck and into the cotton fabric. At least the bus was warm, albeit humid from the bodies all soggy from the rain.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Row upon row of smiling, happy, but sleepy people. Must be nice, she thought, but went to the back of the bus, to the last row which had seemed empty when she first got on. Too much to do, too many things to finish. There isn’t time to be happy when there are deadlines approaching. In some hours they would all be in Pennsylvania, out of the wet and into the dry, only to be into the wet again. Swim meets, nothing is ever dry.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She almost sits atop of Alina, who unfurls her curled up body and moves from the aisle seat toward the already-fogging window and shoving an overstuffed black backpack out of the way.      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Thanks.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Got homework?”      
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Too much, my head hurts.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “You’re all wet, take off your coat before you sit down.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She takes off her raincoat, a sickly pea green that stands out from the other drab slickers. She turns it inside out to blend in. 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>“I think a little creature climbed into my nose.”</p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “That’s nice.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She settles down next to Alina, tucking her bag beneath the seat. This bus is one of those nice ones with the velour plush seats and a bathroom at the back. They are next to the bathroom though, and the smell is almost overwhelming, she can still feel the taste of portable bathroom chemicals despite the bug/god/snot. Alina agrees that yes, the smell is really bad, yes, perhaps they should move up, oh no, there are no more seats.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “When will we get there?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “6:30, but we are going through New York on a Friday. It will take eons.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She did not like to think it would take eons, already re-memories were wiggling into the edges of her vision. Maybe that’s what was in her nose: a little egg of re-memories that birthed horrible images into her head and pain so great in the frontal sinus it brought tears to her eyes.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Alina, I’m having a bad dream but I’m awake.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Oh?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “I’m on this same bus, but there are different people and it’s a different time. We are in California, up from Sacramento, on our way to Ashland, Oregon, it’s going to take six hours. Someone is playing Plague Inc. a few rows up like it’s a joke.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Pre-pandemic?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Pre-pandemic.” 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “What’s so bad about Ashland?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “The past isn’t so bad, I guess I miss it, but I can’t ever go back.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Why’s that?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Well, I miss it because of <i>Macbeth</i>, and all the other good productions there.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Ahh, the mister shaky spear.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She shakes her fist in the air, imitating the act of the name.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “And going back?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Can’t do it, he said he wanted us to get an internship together there. He said he wanted to spend a summer with me. He’s in Spokane so he’s relatively close.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “You don’t mean-”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Yeah, him. So I can’t go back there. I don’t even know if I can go back to Sacramento.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Don’t let him take that away from you.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “He said he wanted to transfer to a school near Providence. Or maybe Florida.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “The gators can eat him.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She and Alina laugh a bit then fall into bumpy silence. Murmurs from the front circulate through the damp air, but most of the team is already deep in a nap. The bus jolts and shivers as it gains speed onto the narrow New England freeway, highway? She wouldn’t know what they are called here, she wasn’t from here. The other girls in rows in front are playing go fish and BS. Talking about how they are passing by towns five, ten, twenty minutes away from home.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Alina, I’m having another bad dream.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “What is it?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “The cards, I remember her, how scary she was but she ended up being so sweet. We were going to a meet like this: overnight, roommates. She shared her chocolate with me and we watched Hawaii Five-Oh.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “The original?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “No, pirated the new one. One-Two-Three-Movies-Dot-Com. My dad told me I was giving all my data to Russian hackers because I used it so much after that.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “That’s not great.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “No, but I miss it. She taught me rat slap and war. I miss her. I wasn’t good enough to her.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “That’s alright, you were growing. Go easy on yourself.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Alina, I’m scared.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Back to silence. There are essays to finish about dactylic hexameter and problem sets about diagonalization to start. Alina lets out a sigh, letting her head drop onto the hard grey plastic surrounding the window. She selfishly wished Alina would lean on her; maybe that was the lizard brain asking for physical contact. Alina wouldn’t give her that satisfaction, though.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Do you ever think about your future?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “All the time. I think I want to be a baker.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “But what about computer science?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “It’s too much. Everything is too much. This work, this life, I want a break.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “I guess a few days of vacation would be nice.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Not even that, just to close my eyes and slip away into darkness for a moment. Or to be able to pause time and get a breather before life starts up this infernal treadmill again. Νο movement, no expectations, no thoughts.” 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Oh.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “I’m sorry.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “No, no, it’s alright.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “I wish my dreams could help me escape but they are always re-memories, just re-living a part of the past that I don’t want or can’t have. It’s painful.” 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Did the things in those re-memories really happen to you or are you making them up?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Gaslight much. I can sometimes convince myself that they didn’t, but then I don’t know what’s real anymore. Everything kind of merges together, like my whole life is condensed into this moment. I don’t know if I’m in the past or the present.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Alina looks at her phone, at which song she’s playing.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Freaking out on the interstate, huh.” 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Alina motions that she needs to get out onto the aisle, so she stands up, gripping to the corduroy backing of the seats in front of her aisle, swaying left, back, right, front, as the bus bounced along the highway, freeway, roadway. She sits back down, her side tingling as if little hands were sprouting from her body to grab at the remnants of warmth Alina left behind. Alina opens the bathroom door, closes it, but doesn’t lock it. “Unoccupied” the green sign reads.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She scoots to the window seat so she doesn’t have to get up again, gazing out the giant glass sheet toward the oncoming traffic and blinding golden light gleaming through furious red and orange trees. The chill from the window stabs at the bug/god/snot like one might stab a toothpick into a cheesecube. A re-memory surfaces, merging with the (checks Google maps, they are in: ) Connecticut autumnal landscape. Yellow beach, a giant cliff to the right that juts out, blue and magnificent, into darker waves. Air-craft carriers lazily scoot along the pencil-thin line of the horizon, while closer to the bay is the big Navy training boat that looks like a cruise ship. Lights blinking on and off in random patterns.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Let’s watch the sunset, not every day that you see it go beneath the water.”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She looked to the left, where the back of the seat should have been, but instead saw past Alina outlined by the Del, lit up in its holiday lights. She supposed it was only a month away from the anniversary of when she’d first seen it in all its red-round-roofed glory. Maybe that’s why her timelines were blurring.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Yes, let’s,” she replies this time though, turning back toward the happy sun. Wishing she could see just one more golden Coronado sunset. Or even one more dusty orange Sacramento sunset with the swirling bats above, or the pink claws of the mountains extending ever higher at Lake Tahoe. She wasn’t from here, she didn’t wear white turtlenecks and brown leather skirts with designer boots and gold jewelry with a puffy purple vest. Where was the tie-dye, the flow, the Santa Cruz sweatshirts? Everything here is skin-tight, suffocating, a cocoon. Liquifying her.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Chewy bar?” present Alina sits back down, a chocolate-chip oatmeal bar sliding next to her thigh.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Thank you,” with all sincerity. The pressure in her nose is too much, then suddenly dissipates. A faucet of sticky mucus sliding down her face, mixing with salty tears that create a web of crusty tracks on her cheeks. She braces for a re-memory, certain of some past that will try to consume her future. Nothing. Just the sweet taste of sugary oats and over-processed chocolate. Echoes of interactions crackle in her inner-ear, “I like your shirt,” “I like your earrings,” “I like your boots,” “I like you.” But those are in the past, and she settles into Alina as the golden glow slowly turns to blue, then inky black. Those little pinpricks of light eons away are the same no matter where she goes. Perhaps it was ok to liquify, to allow that little bug/god/snot to slide out and onto her sleeve. After the cocoon will come the butterfly. But right now she is content with herself in the back row in the dark bus in the unfamiliar state with her new team. Eventually she will grow, she will learn, she will change for the better, but today is for herself.
