      The night breeze sweeps gracefully through the long pink curtains framing the sliding glass doors. 
      They are propped open just enough to allow the thick tube of the telescope to jut into the near 
      darkness of the forest. She can hear the swish of pine needles rubbing against each other, the 
      rush of swift water tumbling over and around her favorite boulders. And the domestic sounds of 
      life, pots clanging to the right from the kitchen, its open window drawing a distinct yellow square 
      on the dusty earth clearing they called a back yard. The click and pause and click of hesitant paws 
      with too-long nails on dirty hardwood floors, one of the dogs sniffing through the house looking for
       a forgotten crumb or sock to steal. She shivers in her too-big KOMPRESSOR t-shirt, a hand-me-down 
       from her father that still smells like the Old Spice Pure Sport deodorant he used. A breath in, letting 
       the cologne smell mix with fresh pine and mud, then she picks up the thick astronomy book and thunks it 
       down on the floor next to the telescope stand.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She opens the hardcover, then aligns it so the wind can riffle through the pages. It obliges, flipping 
      through until seemingly deciding on Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, withdrawing its fingers of chill wreathed
       with the scent of autumn decay. She pulls the book back toward her, using a nearby slipper to prop open 
       the pages and keep the wind from changing its mind. The watercolor picture of the night sky with white 
       dots representing the two constellations is nothing like what she sees through the telescope, and she 
       wonders why the night sky couldn’t provide the faint dashed lines that connect the stars together. How 
       was anyone able to understand this vast map of points? She wondered if she could be recognized as a famous
        astronomer for naming the collection of stars “Cloud of Flies”. That seemed more accurate.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      There was a thump under her bed, followed by the faint sound of scratching, scuffling, and snuffling,
       then another thump under her feet. It knocked the slipper’s toe off of its precarious placement on the 
       book pages. She sat frozen, eye glued in the socket of the telescope. The breeze returned and huddled 
       with her, wrapping its arms around her in fear. It smelled different, like damp fur and the town dump. 
       Slowly, slowly, she kept her eye in the telescope but inched the barrel down. The stars gave way to spear-like 
       tree tops, then silvery blackness of the dense pine thicket, then the grey-brown of the railing at the other 
       end of the large back deck. The full moon was casting strange shadows tonight. The shuffling stopped for a moment, 
       then the sound of brittle wood straining against some large body. She could almost hear the pop though, like 
       a cork from a bottle, as whatever was down there got free.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      Swiveling the telescope to the left a bit, she tried to see if it was over there, no, maybe over to 
      the right? No, oh gods what was that! A big shadow, with a big mouth and big teeth, yawning. The wind 
      melted into the back corner of the room, but she was too scared to pull away from the socket, from this 
      humongous monster blown out of proportion by the telescope. A low chuffing sound came from its throat 
      as its big paw with its long claws went to scratch behind its little ear. If so scary, why were the ears 
      so cute? It turned to face the telescope, it’s eyes gleaming in the moonlight. She wondered if it liked dog treats.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She pulled away from the socket, and the wind that had been hiding sought its sudden escape into the night. 
      The creature snuffled, it smelled the Old Spice Pure Sport shirt. It extended to its full height, reaching 
      tentative paws up and over the railing, then pulling its fluffy hindquarters over and somersaulting to the 
      entrance of the room. It stared at her, front lip in a slight pout out, before heaving a sigh. It bobbed its 
      head, nodding toward the inside. She obliged, moving the telescope stand out of the way. It grunted a bit in 
      the exertion to pull itself from sitting to all fours, then tentatively stepped over the threshold. She moved 
      out of the way to let it in, still firmly grasping the telescope stand almost like a bat. Not that it would 
      do anything, besides it was being so very polite. It shuffled over to her bed and daintily pulled down the 
      comforter with a paw, scooting a stuffed rabbit she had named Edward out of the way, and pulled itself into 
      bed. She set the stand down, peering cautiously at the bear, wondering if there would still be space for her in the bed.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      It let out a longer groan and gnashed its big teeth a bit, maybe it was hungry? She nodded and tiptoed to the 
      door, opening it, closing it, on to the kitchen.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Dada, may I have a peanut butter sandwich please and a glass of milk?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “Um. Didn’t you already have dinner?”
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      “This could be dessert! I have a rumbling in my stomach, pleaaseeee?” 
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      He is easily convinced. She returns to her room, hands shaking as they hold the ceramic plate with the 
      overstuffed peanut butter sandwich and the chunky-handled mug with warm milk. Would its snout be able to 
      fit in the opening of the glass? Surprisingly yes. It scarfed down the sandwich, getting peanut butter on 
      its nose which it attempted to lick away with its tongue, eyes crossed. She stifled a giggle, it was rude 
      to laugh at guests. Then it lapped up the milk, supporting the mug with one paw and clasping the handle with 
      the other pinky up, then finally handed her back the plates, which she placed on the dresser. It smacked its 
      lips, eyes drooping, and sunk deep into the feather mattress. It seemed to be almost drifting to sleep, when 
      it patted an empty patch of blanket next to it and yawned as an invitation.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      She curled up on the little space on the bed, clutching Edward, feeling the warm presence of the big body 
      under the covers. Sleep sealed her eye-lids and cleared her head, and so the bear and the maiden fair shared the bed.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
      When she awoke the next morning it was gone and she was tucked in. Her mouth felt fuzzy, like when you 
      eat a peanut butter sandwich and don’t brush your teeth. It’d been a few years since she’d had a sandwich 
      and milk before bed, a few years since her dad had passed and the tradition had fizzled out. But she 
      remembered it. The wind’s hands caressed her face one last time as the final rays of sun broke into the room, 
      and then it fluttered out into the day, leaving behind the scent of Old Spice Pure Sport.
